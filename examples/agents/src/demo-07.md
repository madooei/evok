# Demo 07: Batch Processing Recipe

## Purpose

This demo shows a practical recipe for processing large collections efficiently using the `createBatchStep` helper, demonstrating controlled parallel processing with realistic email sending simulation.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Controlled batch processing** of user collections
- **Configurable batch sizes** to manage system load
- **Parallel processing within batches** for efficiency
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation for individual failures
- **Result aggregation** tracking both successful and failed operations

## The Batch Processing Recipe

### Configuration

- **Batch size of 2** demonstrates controlled concurrency
- **90% success rate** simulates realistic email delivery scenarios
- **100ms processing time** per email for realistic timing
- **Comprehensive result tracking** for monitoring and reporting

### Processing Flow

1. **Extract items** from state (users to email)
2. **Process in batches** respecting concurrency limits
3. **Handle individual failures** without stopping the entire batch
4. **Update state** with comprehensive results including errors
5. **Emit completion events** for workflow coordination

## Key Benefits

- **Memory efficiency** by processing items in chunks rather than all at once
- **Controlled system load** preventing overwhelming of external services
- **Parallel efficiency** within each batch for faster processing
- **Error isolation** where individual failures don't stop the entire operation
- **Progress tracking** with visibility into batch completion

## Configuration Guidelines

### Small Batches (1-5 items)

- Use for **high-resource operations** or **rate-limited APIs**
- Better **error isolation** and **memory management**
- More **granular progress tracking**

### Medium Batches (10-50 items)

- Balanced approach for **most use cases**
- Good **efficiency** without overwhelming systems
- **Reasonable memory usage** for typical applications

### Large Batches (100+ items)

- Use for **low-resource operations** or **high-throughput systems**
- **Maximum efficiency** for bulk processing
- Requires careful **memory and error management**

## When to Use This Recipe

- **Email sending** to user lists or newsletters
- **File processing** for uploads or transformations
- **API calls** to external services with rate limits
- **Database operations** for bulk inserts or updates
- **Image or media processing** for user content
- **Data validation** across large datasets

## Real-World Applications

- Marketing email campaigns
- User notification systems
- Bulk data import/export operations
- Image resizing and optimization services
- Document processing pipelines
- Social media posting automation
- Inventory synchronization across systems

This recipe provides an essential pattern for scalable applications that need to process large collections efficiently while respecting system constraints and providing proper error handling.

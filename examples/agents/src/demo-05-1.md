# Demo 05-1: Orchestrator-Workers Pattern - Code Analysis

## Purpose

This demo demonstrates the **orchestrator-workers pattern** applied to code analysis, where a central orchestrator dynamically breaks down complex repository analysis into specialized worker tasks that execute in parallel.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Dynamic task decomposition** based on repository structure
- **Specialized worker types** for different analysis tasks
- **Controlled concurrency** with configurable worker limits
- **Result synthesis** combining outputs from multiple analysis types
- **Type-safe worker coordination** with proper TypeScript interfaces

## The Pattern: Orchestrator-Workers

This pattern implements sophisticated task coordination:

1. **Orchestrator** analyzes the main task and creates specialized subtasks
2. **Workers** execute different types of analysis in parallel
3. **Task Queue** manages work distribution with priority and concurrency control
4. **Synthesizer** combines all worker results into comprehensive analysis

## Analysis Types Implemented

### Complexity Analysis Workers

- Analyze code complexity metrics for each file
- Generate complexity scores for maintainability assessment

### Coverage Analysis Workers

- Check test coverage percentages for each file
- Identify files needing more comprehensive testing

### Security Scan Workers

- Perform security vulnerability scanning
- Identify potential security issues with severity ratings

## Key Benefits

- **Scalable analysis** - handles repositories of any size
- **Parallel processing** - multiple files analyzed simultaneously
- **Specialized expertise** - different workers for different analysis types
- **Comprehensive results** - combines multiple analysis dimensions
- **Configurable concurrency** - balance speed vs resource usage

## Configuration Highlights

- **4 concurrent workers** for optimal parallelism
- **5-second timeouts** preventing stuck workers
- **Priority-based task scheduling** for important files first
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation for failed analyses

## When to Use

- **Complex multi-dimensional analysis** requiring different expertise
- **Large-scale processing** where parallelism provides significant benefits
- **Variable workloads** where task breakdown can't be predicted
- **Quality assurance workflows** requiring comprehensive coverage
- **Repository maintenance** and technical debt assessment

## Real-World Applications

- Automated code review systems
- CI/CD pipeline quality gates
- Technical debt assessment tools
- Security compliance checking
- Performance analysis suites
- Documentation coverage analysis

This pattern excels when you need sophisticated coordination of specialized workers to handle complex, multi-faceted analysis tasks efficiently.

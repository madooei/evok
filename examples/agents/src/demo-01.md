# Demo 01: Prompt Chaining Pattern

## Purpose

This demo demonstrates the **prompt chaining pattern** where complex tasks are decomposed into a sequence of steps, with each step processing the output of the previous one to achieve higher accuracy through specialized processing.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Sequential task decomposition** into specialized steps
- **LLM simulation** with realistic API call timing
- **Progressive data enrichment** through the pipeline
- **Event-driven step coordination** without tight coupling

## The Pattern: Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining is ideal when tasks can be cleanly broken down into fixed subtasks. Instead of trying to do everything in one large prompt, you:

1. **Analyze** the input text
2. **Summarize** the analyzed content
3. **Translate** the summary
4. **Extract** keywords from the translation

Each step builds on the previous one's output, allowing for specialized processing and higher overall accuracy.

## Key Benefits

- **Higher accuracy** through specialized steps
- **Better error isolation** - failures are contained to specific steps
- **Easier debugging** - each step can be tested independently
- **Flexibility** - steps can be modified or reordered without affecting others

## When to Use

- **Complex multi-stage processing** that benefits from specialization
- **Tasks requiring different prompting strategies** at each stage
- **Workflows where intermediate validation** might be needed
- **Processes that trade latency for accuracy**

## Real-World Applications

- Document analysis and processing pipelines
- Content moderation workflows
- Multi-language content processing
- Research and fact-checking workflows
- Creative writing assistance with multiple revision stages

This pattern forms the foundation for many AI-driven workflows where sequential refinement produces better results than single-shot processing.

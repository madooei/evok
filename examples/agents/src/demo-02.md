# Demo 02: Routing Pattern

## Purpose

This demo demonstrates the **routing pattern** where an initial classification step determines which specialized processing path to follow, enabling dynamic decision-making and resource optimization.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Dynamic routing** based on content classification
- **Conditional workflow branching** using event payloads
- **Resource optimization** by matching complexity to capability
- **Specialized processing paths** for different query types

## The Pattern: Routing

Routing involves an initial LLM call that analyzes the input and decides which model or processing path should handle the request. This allows for:

1. **Query Classification** - Analyze and categorize the incoming request
2. **Route Selection** - Choose the appropriate processing path
3. **Specialized Processing** - Handle the request with the best-suited approach

## Key Benefits

- **Cost optimization** - Simple queries use faster, cheaper models
- **Performance optimization** - Complex queries get appropriate processing power
- **Quality optimization** - Technical queries use specialized models
- **Resource efficiency** - No over-processing of simple requests

## Routing Strategies Shown

- **Simple queries** → Fast, lightweight processing
- **Complex queries** → Advanced reasoning and analysis
- **Technical queries** → Specialized technical model with code examples
- **Default fallback** → Safe handling of unclassified queries

## When to Use

- **Variable complexity workloads** with different processing needs
- **Cost-sensitive applications** where efficiency matters
- **Multi-model architectures** with specialized capabilities
- **User-facing systems** with diverse query types
- **Applications with performance requirements** that vary by request type

## Real-World Applications

- Customer support chatbots with tiered response systems
- Content moderation with different severity levels
- Code assistance with language-specific routing
- Document processing with format-specific handlers
- Educational platforms with difficulty-based routing

This pattern is essential for building scalable, efficient AI systems that can handle diverse workloads intelligently.

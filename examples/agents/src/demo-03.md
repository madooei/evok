# Demo 03: Parallelization Pattern

## Purpose

This demo demonstrates the **parallelization pattern** where tasks are broken into independent components that can be processed simultaneously, dramatically reducing overall processing time through concurrent execution.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Parallel task execution** with multiple simultaneous workers
- **Result synchronization** waiting for all parallel tasks to complete
- **Fan-out/fan-in pattern** from one task to many, then back to one
- **State coordination** tracking multiple parallel results

## The Pattern: Parallelization

Parallelization breaks work into independent chunks that can be processed concurrently:

1. **Split Phase** - Break the main task into parallel components
2. **Process Phase** - Execute multiple workers simultaneously
3. **Synchronize Phase** - Wait for all parallel work to complete
4. **Synthesize Phase** - Combine results into final output

## Key Benefits

- **Dramatically reduced latency** through concurrent processing
- **Better resource utilization** using available parallelism
- **Scalability** - more workers can handle larger workloads
- **Independence** - failures in one worker don't affect others

## Coordination Strategy

The workflow uses event counting to determine when all parallel work is complete:

- Track expected number of pages (3)
- Count completed page analyses
- Trigger synthesis only when all pages are analyzed

## When to Use

- **Independent parallel tasks** like processing multiple documents
- **Voting mechanisms** across multiple LLM calls for consensus
- **Batch processing** of similar items
- **Data parallelism** where the same operation applies to different data
- **Time-sensitive workflows** where latency reduction is critical

## Real-World Applications

- Multi-page document analysis and OCR
- Parallel image or video processing
- Consensus-based decision making with multiple AI models
- Batch processing of user uploads
- Multi-language translation services
- Parallel research and fact-checking across multiple sources

This pattern is essential for scalable AI systems that need to process large workloads efficiently while maintaining result quality.

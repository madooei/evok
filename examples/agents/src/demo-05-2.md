# Demo 05-2: Orchestrator-Workers Pattern - E-commerce Fulfillment

## Purpose

This demo demonstrates the **orchestrator-workers pattern** applied to e-commerce order fulfillment, showing how complex business processes can be decomposed into parallel operations with proper coordination and error handling.

## What It Demonstrates

- **Business process orchestration** with real-world complexity
- **Multi-stage fulfillment pipeline** with dependencies and coordination
- **Priority-based task execution** for urgent vs standard orders
- **Error handling and graceful degradation** for failed operations
- **Comprehensive fulfillment tracking** across multiple dimensions

## The Fulfillment Pipeline

### Orchestrator Phase

- Analyzes order requirements and breaks into fulfillment tasks
- Creates inventory checks, packing tasks, and shipping operations
- Sets up priority and dependency relationships

### Worker Operations

#### Inventory Workers

- Check item availability across multiple warehouses
- Reserve inventory for confirmed available items
- Handle out-of-stock scenarios gracefully

#### Packing Workers

- Process physical order packing with weight/dimension calculation
- Generate package identifiers for tracking
- Coordinate with inventory reservations

#### Shipping Workers

- Create shipping labels with carrier selection
- Calculate delivery estimates based on order priority
- Handle express vs standard shipping logic

### Synthesis Phase

- Combines all fulfillment results into comprehensive order status
- Tracks successful operations and failed tasks
- Provides complete fulfillment summary for customer notification

## Key Features

- **Express order prioritization** with faster delivery options
- **Multi-warehouse inventory** checking and reservation
- **Carrier selection logic** (UPS, FedEx, DHL)
- **Realistic timing simulation** with variable processing delays
- **Error tolerance** with partial fulfillment capabilities

## Configuration

- **5 concurrent workers** for order processing efficiency
- **10-second timeouts** for individual fulfillment operations
- **Priority scheduling** ensuring express orders get precedence
- **Graceful error handling** for individual task failures

## When to Use

- **Complex business processes** with multiple interdependent operations
- **Order fulfillment systems** requiring parallel processing
- **Supply chain coordination** across multiple warehouses/vendors
- **Time-sensitive operations** with varying priority levels
- **Systems requiring partial success handling** and error recovery

## Real-World Applications

- E-commerce order processing systems
- Supply chain management platforms
- Inventory management and allocation
- Multi-vendor marketplace fulfillment
- Subscription box processing
- B2B order coordination systems

This pattern demonstrates how complex business processes can be efficiently orchestrated using parallel workers while maintaining proper coordination and error handling for production systems.

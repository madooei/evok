# Batch Step Helper

## Purpose

The `createBatchStep` helper processes collections of items in parallel batches, providing efficient bulk processing capabilities with configurable batch sizes and comprehensive logging.

## When to Use

Use `createBatchStep` when you need to:

- **Process large datasets**: Handle hundreds or thousands of items efficiently
- **Control concurrency**: Limit parallel operations to avoid overwhelming systems
- **Bulk API operations**: Make multiple API calls in controlled batches
- **Data pipeline processing**: Transform collections of records or files
- **Rate-limited operations**: Respect API rate limits by controlling batch sizes

## Key Benefits

- **Configurable batch size**: Control how many items process simultaneously
- **Parallel processing**: Items within each batch process concurrently
- **Progress tracking**: Built-in logging shows batch progress
- **Memory efficient**: Processes items in chunks rather than all at once
- **Flexible configuration**: Custom functions for extracting items, processing, and updating state

## Configuration Options

- **getItems**: Extract the collection to process from current state
- **processItem**: Define how to process each individual item
- **updateState**: Specify how to incorporate results back into state
- **batchSize**: Set the number of items to process per batch

## Example Use Cases

- Processing uploaded files in batches
- Making bulk API requests with rate limiting
- Transforming large datasets
- Sending emails to multiple recipients
- Validating collections of user inputs
- Image or media processing workflows

This helper is essential for scalable workflows that need to handle large collections efficiently while maintaining system stability.

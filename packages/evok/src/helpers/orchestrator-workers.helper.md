# Orchestrator-Workers Helper

## Purpose

The `createOrchestratorWorkersWorkflow` helper implements the orchestrator-workers pattern, enabling complex task decomposition and parallel processing with controlled concurrency and result synthesis.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when you need to:

- **Decompose complex tasks**: Break large operations into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Parallel processing**: Execute multiple related tasks concurrently
- **Controlled concurrency**: Limit the number of simultaneous workers
- **Dynamic workload distribution**: Handle varying numbers of subtasks
- **Result aggregation**: Combine outputs from multiple workers into final results
- **Scalable processing**: Handle workloads that grow with input size

## Key Benefits

- **Automatic task distribution**: Orchestrator breaks down work and manages workers
- **Concurrency control**: Configure maximum simultaneous workers
- **Progress tracking**: Built-in monitoring of task completion
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of individual task failures
- **Result synthesis**: Automatic aggregation of worker outputs
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed visibility into orchestration process

## Architecture Components

### Orchestrator Step

- Analyzes the main task and breaks it into subtasks
- Initializes worker tracking and task queues
- Configures concurrency limits

### Worker Step

- Processes individual subtasks in parallel
- Manages worker lifecycle and capacity
- Handles timeouts and error recovery
- Continues processing until all tasks complete

### Synthesizer Step

- Collects results from all workers
- Handles both successful and failed tasks
- Combines results into final workflow state

## Configuration Requirements

- **taskBreakdown**: Function to decompose main task into subtasks
- **workerFactory**: Function to create workers for specific task types
- **synthesizeResults**: Function to combine worker results
- **maxConcurrentWorkers**: Optional concurrency limit (default: 3)
- **workerTimeout**: Optional timeout for individual tasks

## State Requirements

Your state must extend `OrchestratorState` which includes:

- Task tracking (pending, active, completed)
- Worker management and status
- Result collection and error handling

## Example Use Cases

- Parallel data processing pipelines
- Distributed computation tasks
- Bulk API operations with rate limiting
- Multi-file processing workflows
- Parallel validation and enrichment
- Microservice orchestration
- Map-reduce style operations

This helper is ideal for complex workflows requiring sophisticated task decomposition and parallel execution with proper coordination and result aggregation.

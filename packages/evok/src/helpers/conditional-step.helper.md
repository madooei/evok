# Conditional Step Helper

## Purpose

The `createConditionalStep` helper adds conditional execution logic to workflow steps, allowing steps to run only when specific conditions are met, or skip execution entirely based on the current state.

## When to Use

Use `createConditionalStep` when you need:

- **Branching logic**: Execute different paths based on state conditions
- **Optional processing**: Skip steps that aren't relevant for certain scenarios
- **Feature flags**: Enable/disable functionality based on configuration
- **User permissions**: Execute steps only for authorized users
- **Data validation**: Only proceed if data meets certain criteria
- **Environment-specific logic**: Different behavior for dev/staging/production

## Key Benefits

- **Dynamic workflow control**: Runtime decisions about step execution
- **Clean skip handling**: Proper event emission when steps are skipped
- **Comprehensive logging**: Clear visibility into condition evaluation
- **Custom skip events**: Define specific events for skipped scenarios
- **Preserved workflow state**: State remains unchanged when conditions aren't met

## Configuration Options

- **condition**: Function that evaluates current state and returns boolean
- **stepLogic**: The actual step logic to execute when condition is true
- **skipEvent**: Optional custom event to emit when step is skipped

## Example Use Cases

- User role-based workflow steps
- Processing based on data completeness
- Environment-specific integrations
- Feature toggle implementations
- Validation-dependent operations
- Optional notification steps
- Conditional data enrichment

This helper enables intelligent, adaptive workflows that respond appropriately to different runtime conditions while maintaining clear execution paths.
